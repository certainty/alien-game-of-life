# Game of life in common lisp

## Prerequisites 

1. [Common Lisp implementation](https://roswell.github.io/)
2. [Quicklisp](https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/)

In summary, you should know how to develop with common lisp. Sorry for the inconvenience :)

## Run it

 `make run` 

## Compatibility

The code should be portable accross implementations, although I've only tested it with SBCL.
